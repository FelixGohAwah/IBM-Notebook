# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python

# In[5]:


# This is a simple arithmetic expression to multiply then add integers

Answer = (3 * 4) + 5
print(Answer)


# In[6]:


# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by dividing by 60

minutes = 200
hours = minutes / 60
print(hours, "hours")
